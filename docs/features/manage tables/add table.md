### 2. with graphics

To add a table with graphics you have to click the menulink "Tische graphisch verwalten" (1) you should get a overview of your room and the tables with its positions.

When you press "Tisch hinzuf√ºgen" (2) following windows will appear. The only difference between the step without graphic is that you have to define the position of the table. You can do that with pressing the button "Positionieren" (1) and drawing a rect. Then press save ("Speichern") and the table will appear in the overview and the frontend.
